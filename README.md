If you're like me, then you are constantly making media for different social media platforms. I know it's not always easy or straight forward when trying to create something that looks good on different social platforms and devices. 

That's why I decided to create this comprehensive framework for creating and structuring beautiful, mobile-ready images, videos, graphics and other social media content - all in Figma!

The purpose of this framework is to help you create consistent, beautiful social media images for any platform. There are many of the most popular sizes for social media posts ready to go, just choose one and start designing. This framework is organized so that it's easier to find sizes for different types of posts. You can easily see how your design would look on all the different platforms you are creating content for.

With this framework you'll be able to easily create beautiful posts that work on all platforms, so you never have to worry about sizing again!

If you found this useful and would like to support me, you can check my Twitter or my Github. I‚Äôm always open to feedback and requests, so if there‚Äôs anything you want me to cover in the future, let me know!
